## Project Overview and Motivation
This project leverages data on covid-19 vaccination and infection rates to draw conclusion on potential correlations between a high vaccination rate and a low infection rate. A subset of countries will be selected and ranked against each other.

## Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/nievesrd-ai/data-scientist-nanodeg-proj1.git
		data-scientist-nanodeg-proj1
	```
2. Download the [Vaccination Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress/metadata).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `data-scientist-nanodeg-proj1/`.
3. Download the [Infection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `data-scientist-nanodeg-proj1/`.
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to requirements.txt
5. Open a terminal and run jupyter notebook command. In the jupyter notebook file browser, open `project_01.ipynb`
